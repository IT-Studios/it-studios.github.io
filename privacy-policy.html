                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly
                used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your
                browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your
                device's internal memory. This Service does not use these

                and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and
                improve their services. You have the option to either accept or
                refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to
